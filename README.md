## Introduction

This app creates a profile that stores the data from each entered meal. The user can then access their data to keep track of how their eating is affecting their daily calorie intake and whether they are meeting their goal. They can also view that data over a longer period of time helping them visually see changes being made in their diet. Using certain error checking functions we make it easy for the user to use our program without confusion.
