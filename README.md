## Introduction

This app creates a profile that stores the data from each entered meal. The user can then access their data to keep track of how their eating is affecting their daily calorie intake and whether they are meeting their goal. They can also view that data over a longer period of time helping them visually see changes being made in their diet. Using certain error checking functions we make it easy for the user to use our program without confusion.

## How To Use

To use this application download the zip file by clicking the green code button and selecting the zip option. Once downloaded, extract the files and then import it into your own workspace on eclipse.

Once you run the application you will be taken to a login page where you can either chose to login as an existing user or click on a button that will take you to a new page where you can enter your information. This information is then stored in an array list of users under your chosen username. Depending on the goal you selected and the height and weight you entered it will calculate the amount of calories that are recommended for the selected goal.

Once you are logged into the main user page you can see the data from the entries entered on that day. If the screen doesn't have any data, click the new food button to begin tracking your meals for the day. You enter each food item on the NewFood page that made up your meal (ex. steak, brocolli, potatoes). Once you have added each individual food item click on save meal. This will populate the main user page with the data you just entered by calculating the total calories, carbs, fats, and proteins.

To see the data broken down for the month click on the monthly summary button which will take you to a scene where you can see the average carbs, fats, proteins, and calories from the month. It will also show the total calories for the month broken down by their macronutrients. 

As you get older and lose or gain weight you can use the update user button on the main user page to update these values. Here you can also change your goal which in turn changes the goal amount of calories you are looking to consume each day.
